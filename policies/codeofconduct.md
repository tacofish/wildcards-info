1. Be constructive in your criticisms of other players. They're trying, so offer them some tips and pointers instead of just telling them they're bad.
2. Be on time, or your spot may be given up.
3. Keep your cool. Wipes and mistakes will and can happen. Don't scream at people in Discord.
4. Keep an open mind. No one knows everything; even the developers of WoW. Be open to feedback and new ideas.
5. Show up to raids prepared. We all need to put forth effort to be ready to clear content. No one is exempt.
6. Keep things civil. Tensions will run high when we hit a new boss. No one downs new content on their first try. Don't rage and let us know if you need a breather to cool your temper.
7. Put forward your best effort. This isn't a team that's going to judge you if you don't put up crazy numbers, but we ask that you put in the effort to improve. We use Deadpool's war cry as an expectation: "Maximum effort!"
8. During raid fights, keep the voice channel clear for raid relevant communication.
9. No damage meters in public channels. We use damage meters only to look at how we're doing during a raid; not to shame or boot people.
