## Weak Auras Information
Weak Auras is a simple way to see your cooldowns in a central location (this is highly customizable). This is a bit daunting if you're
starting from scratch, but there's a site that has a bunch of weakauras configurations that work for various classes and specs.

[Wago](https://wago.io/weakauras/)

My best advice is to select your class and spec, and sort by number of stars. A favorite and *very* well done set are the Ipse's auras,
which tend to cover multiple specs and center the cool down indicators around your character.

## Healer Addon suggestions
