Just a couple of announcements this week:
- Our first Wildcards-only raid occurred on Saturday, resulting in an 8/10 run in to Normal Nighthold (N NH). Great job!
- Recruitment efforts continuing, with focus on ranged DPS, a tank, and heals moving forward.
- Team news.
- Attendance policy

I want to congratulate the team on a great first regular run! We did great and ran long, but I hope it was tons of fun for everyone!

This weekend's run is Normal Nighthold. Please review the Elisande and Guldan fights and understand the mechanics. If you haven't done them on Looking for Raid, that's a good place to practice without being punished for mistakes too harshly.

I've been reviewing logs for the raid last week, and I'll start providing feedback individually, shortly. All in all, we did really well and only had minor issues (mostly getting used to the team and some minor mechanics work). Nothing unexpected or serious, and practice will get us through. I don't think we'll be stuck on Elisande and Guldan for long, and then we'll look at venturing into Heroic.

A bit on how our fights will be placed on "farm" status; each boss we run through without a wipe and without being on the brink of a wipe will be placed on farm status. Normally, we want to down the boss at least two consecutive weeks without issue before placing it on the farm list, but older raids will end up there faster to allow for optional "gear up" days. The following is the "on farm" list thus far:

- N EN
- N ToV

Nighthold bosses will remain off of farm until we have no mechanics issues. Fights like Spellblade, Tichondrius, and Anomaly will remain off of farm until the mechanics are down. That's not a slam, but those seemed to be fights that stretched us a bit.

I also didn't use master looter last raid, which may have hurt some gear distribution and made things more chaotic. In the event that this happens, please ensure that any gear you don't need is posted to raid chat so we can roll it off. We will be using a loot council as time progresses to ensure we maximize our raids effectiveness, and provide a nice need based loot distribution system.

Raid attendance is loose, and I won't be taking attendance. However, please make sure that you try to attend. If you can't make it, a quick note to one of Killacamron's many alts or myself would be greatly appreciated. If you can't attend for an extended period of time, let us know and we'll work around it. Discord, in-game mail, etc... is sufficient. If your computer dies, discord has a mobile app that you can use to ping one of us, and we'll see you when you return. Extended unnotified absences may result in your removal from the team until your return. We know life happens and will accommodate you, but we have to make room for those that will provide us the same consideration we try to provide to everyone.

I look forward to seeing everyone back in Nighthold on Saturday!
