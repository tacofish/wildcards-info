Hello!

Our farming needs are all over the map, and I've not determined specific needs. However, we're
just starting out, so we need to farm everything. Here's a brief list:

- Flask materials
  - Flask of the Ten Thousand Scars (1950 Stamina)
    - Starlight Rose x 7
    - Aethril x 10
    - Dreamleaf x 10
    - Crystal Vial (purchasable)
  - Flask of the Countless Armies (1300 Strength)
    - Starlight Rose x 7
    - Aethril x 10
    - Foxflower x 10
    - Crystal Vial (purchasable)
  - Flask of the Whispered Pact (1300 Intellect)
    - Starlight Rose x 7
    - Fjarnskaggl x 10
    - Dreamleaf x 10
    - Crystal Vial (purchasable)
  - Flask of the Seventh Demon (1300 Agility)
    - Starlight Rose x 7
    - Foxflower x 10
    - Fjarnskaggl x 10
    - Crystal Vial (purchasable)
  - Spirit Cauldron
    - Flask of the Whispered Pact x 5
    - Flask of the Seventh Demon x 5
    - Flask of the Countless Armies x 5
    - Flask of Ten Thousand Scars x 5
    - Blood of Sargeras
  - Lavish Suramar Feast
    - Leybeque Ribs x 5
    - Suramar Surf and Turf x 5
    - Barracuda Mrglgagh x 5
    - Koi-Scented Stormray x 5
    - Drogbar-Style Salmon x 5
    - Slice of Bacon x 5

Our highest priority during bootstrapping will be cauldrons and feasts. Mostly because it makes a collective effort
towards flasks and buff foods. If you want to farm for specific personal foods, please feel free. These are just
towards raid-wide benefits. 

Combat potions, having very short term and temporary effects, are not recommended for fights that aren't close, or first attempts.
That being the case, I am not putting materials on the farm list.

I advise against using Elixirs, as these don't persist through death. As we're starting out, we're going to die, and I don't
want people wasting time and gold.
