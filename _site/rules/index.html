<ol>
  <li>We welcome alts, but there are a few things to note if you’re going to want to make your raider an alt character:
    <ul>
      <li>We will have a bit more than we need for raiding on the team. This ensures that a small number of absences don’t cause raids to be canceled.</li>
      <li>Invites go out based on a rotation. We will rotate players in and out based on fight needs, and whether or not they participated the last week.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>If someone was sat out the week before, they’ll have a spot in the current weeks raid.
      * Main characters will always be given preference for raid spots.</li>
      <li>If a main and an alt character are logged in to raid, both on time and prepared, the main will get the invite. This is in line with our vision of bringing raiding to those who wouldn’t normally be able to raid.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Loot distribution will be done in a classic master loot fashion when it is a full team raid.
    <ul>
      <li>We will weight decisions based on well known criteria:</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Main characters get loot preference. We are fine getting alts gear, but main characters are given first take.</li>
      <li>Preference will be given to what benefits the team overall. Ie. An 875 ilvl trinket drops. It is best in slot for a mage and a massive upgrade, but a tank wants it too; the trinket would go to the mage.</li>
      <li>If the above criteria result in a “tie” during evaluation, the loot will distribute in a round-robin fashion.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Farming is a part of raiding. We will have team farming sessions, which all members are encouraged to join, but this does not replace farming for individuals materials.</li>
  <li>We encourage everyone to get involved with helping shape the teams policies, procedures, strategies and rules to best fit our mission.
    <ul>
      <li>The only strict rules are those placed upon the Currently Online guild(s) themselves.</li>
      <li>Iteration upon how we operate is always a good thing, and improvement ideas can come from anywhere. Let the Team Managers know if you have suggestions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="rules">Rules</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Be respectful.</li>
  <li>Show up ready to raid.</li>
  <li>Be willing to help others.</li>
  <li>Abide by the rules of the Currently Online guilds. Review them <a href="http://www.coguild.com/rules/">here</a>.</li>
  <li>During raids, abide by the Raiding Code of Conduct outlined <a href="/conduct/">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Guild bank materials are only accessible to Team Managers. If you need something, ask, do not help yourself.</li>
  <li>Be open minded and receptive to feedback, but also provide constructive feedback.</li>
  <li>Keep disputes in private messages. This is to make sure resolution is met without disrupting others.</li>
</ol>
