        <div class="home">
          <p>Welcome to the Wildcards! If you’ve found yourself here, you’ve decided to embark on a
mission with us to bring raiding to the masses and allow players to experience raiding in a positive
and relaxed environment. As you’ve decided to come with us through WoW content as part of the team, I want
to provide detail around why we exist, and what keeps us going.<br />
<br />
Currently Online is a massive community of WoW players of all kinds of backgrounds and interests. Many people
raid, do mythics, farm, and otherwise just have fun in all sorts of ways. There was one problem… the raid teams
had requirements that some either couldn’t meet or thought they couldn’t; and there isn’t a thing wrong with any of that.
We saw a gap, however, and wanted to help fulfill that gap and bring raid content in its glory to those that
couldn’t make hardcore raid schedules, felt like they weren’t good enough to raid and didn’t have a place to learn,
or just felt like hardcore raiding wasn’t for them.<br />
<br />
With that in mind, the idea to start a casual raid team that had a more flexible schedule arose. One that would
help newer raiders and players learn what it takes to raid, get them into raid content, and help them improve their
play. We wanted an environment in which players could learn without fear of getting ridiculed or feel embarrassed
if they didn’t have their rotations down, etc… In that sense, we wanted to encourage people to raid and experience
WoW content.<br />
<br />
With that being said, this team is not a safe space and feedback will be candid. While it will be provided in a
constructive manner, we expect and demand that players that are given feedback will take those points and try to
improve, and in turn will offer constructive feedback. Raiding is a stressful environment. Wiping happens, people get
frustrated with mistakes, and the farming requirements to show up with what you need to be raid ready aren’t
small. However as a team, we strive to make sure we pull people up when they’re having a hard time or a bad day
raiding instead of beating them down.<br />
<br />
This small site is meant to act as a living document of our strategies, raid requirements, useful links,
class specific pointers and strategies we’ve found effective, and other miscellaneous information that
we find useful.<br />
<br />
I hope all of this sounds like fun and excites you as much as it does us. With all of that out of the way;
welcome to the Wildcards!<br />
