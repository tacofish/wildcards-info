    <ul>
      <li>DON'T be a jerk. Everyone is learning and always looking to improve. Feedback should be constructive.</li>
      <li>DON'T spam raid chat outside of breaks during progression runs. Communication is key while trying to down new content.</li>
      <li>DO help others. We'll find people struggling, and we should help them elevate their game through tips and tricks.</li>
      <li>DO give pointers for strategy adjustments.</li>
      <li>DON'T rage on people during a wipe.</li>
      <li>DO keep discord voice clear during pulls.</li>
      <li>DO read strategies prior to raid day. We will provide reminder explanations, but we expect some degree of preparation.</li>
      <li>DO listen to the raid leader(s) and tanks. They coordinate pulls.</li>
